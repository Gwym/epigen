# epigen

"Epigenetics" : Web framework written in Typescript as a shared foundation for projects yenah, sulcus, bci.ts and hopefully more.

![epigen](https://github.com/Gwym/epigen/blob/master/frontend/en/logo.png)

Contains (partly) : logging, configuration, common libraries, Web and Websocket server, static file server,  persistor management (MongoDB), User sign in, registration and sessions, States-Events-Actions Machines, simple shared server/frontend ressources sharing.

To come : Event-driven testing framework, G+/FB users, Cloud API access, Typescript "module manager" that works by signature (and not by versions) to allow the dynamic loading and mixing of code parts with compatible interfaces.
